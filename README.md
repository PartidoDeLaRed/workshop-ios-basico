Basic iOS XCode project written Swift that simple uses the reddit REST API to populate a table view with reddit posts titles/author. Clicking on a cell in the table will open a new view that contains a web view, which then loads the complete post.

There are no slides, just the XCode project and an image. 

To open the project (XCode required) simply open the file RedditThing.xcworkspace. To run it, just click XCode's play button on the top left. 

The image contains the familiar MVC pattern, but as the Cocoa framework uses it with notifications, delegation and protocols.
